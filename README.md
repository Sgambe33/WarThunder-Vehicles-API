# WAR THUNDER API

This API allows to fetch data about all the in-game vehicles, even those hidden or event related. From vehicle performance to their economic cost, from their guns to their weapon presets. Since it's still a work in progress there may be errors in the data but more information will be added as development goes on.

The documentation can be found [here](http://wtvehiclesapi.sgambe.serv00.net/docs).
There is no call limit but please do not overload the server with requests as the RAM is limited.

## Changelog

- 2.0.0: Completely reworked the API to be faster and avoid DB connection issues. More data has been added to each vehicle such as modifications, required vehicle in tech tree, custom presets etc...
- 1.0.0: Initial release


## Roadmap

Project's roadmap can be consulted [here](https://github.com/users/Sgambe33/projects/4/views/1). Users are welcomed to create issues to ask for more specific data.
