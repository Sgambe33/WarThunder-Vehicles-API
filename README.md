# WAR THUNDER API

>⚠ *Attention: the api is being reworked and rewritten to improve data coverage and performance. There is no ETA. Any help offer can be submitted with an issue.* ⚠

This API allows to fetch data about all the in-game vehicles, even those hidden or event related. From vehicle performance to their economic cost, from their guns to their weapon presets. Since it's still a work in progress there may be errors in the data but more information will be added as development goes on.

The documentation can be found at Swagger [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Sgambe33/WarThunder-API/1.0.0).
There is no call limit but please do not overload the server with requests as the RAM is limited. Any suggestion or request is very welcome.
